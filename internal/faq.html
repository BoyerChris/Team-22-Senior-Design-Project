                    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1> <br>
                    <h2>Q1: I tried running your tool(s) but nothing happened?</h2>
                    <p>Many of our tools utilize powershell scripts in order to perform the scans or changes that they have been designed to do, however many systems have powershell scripting disabled by default, make sure your system has powershell scripting enabled before you run our tools!</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Q2: What do I do with the download file after I've ran the tool?</h2>
                    <p>Once the tool has completed running, we ask that you move the download file to your recycle bin and delete it. This is because we are constantly updating our tools in order to make them safer, faster, and more capable. As such keeping an old version of a tool on your computer is a inefficient use of recources.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Q3: A new version of a tool I already used just released, do I need to re-run the tool again?</h2>
                    <p>It depends. Some updates to the tools may be minor, like small bug fixes or gramatical fixes. In this case you do not need to re-run it. However some updates may include entriely new features, in this case we recommend re-running the tool. To tell exactly what changes were made to a tool, please check out the updates page on the home screen.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Q4: Your tools were marked as malicious by my antivirus, should I be worried?</h2>
                    <p>No, this just means your antivirus was doing a good job. In order to find vulnerabilities and make changes to your system our tools by design are fairly intrusive. Due to this intrusive nature your antivirus may flag our tools as malicious, but feel free to disregard it.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Q5: Where am I allowed to run these tools?</h2>
                    <p>You may only run the tools provided within our solution in networks where you have the permission to do so. Some examples include your own personal networks that you own such as a home network, or any foreign networks where you have obtained permission from the relevant personal. Operating in areas without permission is against our EULA and may result in legal action.</p>
                    <br>
