                        <h3>What is a Patch Scanner?</h3> <hr /> 
                        <p>Our Patch Scanner is a scanner designed to identify missing updates on a Windows system by leveraging built-in Windows features. It scans for security updates, 
                            cumulative patches, and third-party software updates, categorizing them for easy identification. This script requires administrative privileges to ensure 
                            full access to update information, helping maintain system security and performance.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How it Works</h3> <hr /> 
                        <p>When missing updates are detected, our Patch Scanner generates a detailed report listing all pending patches. It achieves this by leveraging PowerShell's 
                            capability to retrieve Windows updates and perform additional tasks using the Get-WindowsUpdate command. If no updates are found, the script confirms 
                            that your system is fully up to date. This scanner helps maintain system security by ensuring critical updates are identified and applied promptly.</p> 

                        <h3>How to Use</h3><hr />
                        <p>After downloading the Patch Scanner, simply double-click the executable file to run the tool. You will receive a prompt from your computer 
                            requesting administrative privileges; please confirm this prompt. If you do not receive the prompt, please right-click the executable and 
                            select "Run as administrator." Once launched, the program runs automatically, scanning your system for any missing Windows updates. When the 
                            process is complete, you will receive a detailed list of necessary patches, and a file containing this information will be saved for future 
                            reference on your C: drive.</p> <br>

                            <h2>Backup Scanner</h2>
                        </div>

                        <h3>What is a Backup Scanner?</h3> <hr /> 
                        <p>Our Backup Scanner is a scanner that verifies a system's backup readiness by checking the status of File History and System Restore. It ensures that 
                            File History, which provides continuous file backups, is enabled and confirms the availability of System Restore points. If either feature is 
                            disabled, the scanner notifies the user and recommends enabling them for enhanced data protection. </p>

                        <h3>How it Works</h3> <hr /> 
                        <p>The scanner accomplishes its scanning by harnessing PowerShell's ability to extract information from the registry using the Get-ItemProperty command.
                            By using this scanner, users can quickly assess their backup status and take the necessary 
                            actions to minimize the risk of data loss in the event of a system failure.&zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj;&zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj;&zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj;  &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj; &zwnj;  </p>

                        <h3>What is a Network Adapter Scanner?</h3> <hr /> 
                        <p>A Network Adapter Scanner is a security tool designed to analyze your system’s network adapters for their NetBIOS and DNS configurations. 
                            It retrieves and displays these settings for each adapter and assesses whether the configurations are classified as “Risky” or “Secure.” 
                            By identifying misconfigurations, this tool helps users detect potential vulnerabilities that could expose their system to cyber threats. </p>
                    
                        <h3>How it Works</h3> <hr />      
                        <p> This scanner is essential for detecting attack vectors caused by improper network adapter settings. It achieves this by leveraging PowerShell's 
                            capability to retrieve information from network adapters and the registry using the Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty and Get-DnsClientServerAddress commands. 
                            Ensuring secure configurations helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data exposure through network misconfigurations.</p>

                        <h3>How to Use</h3><hr />
                        <p>After downloading the Network Adapter Scanner, double-click the executable file to launch it. You will receive a prompt requesting 
                            administrative privileges—confirm this to proceed. If the prompt does not appear, right-click the executable and select "Run as administrator." 
                            The scanner will then run automatically. Once completed, it will generate a detailed report listing all network adapters, highlighting any 
                            misconfigurations, and indicating whether their settings are secure or need attention. If a “Risky” configuration is detected, users are advised to take note of the affected adapter and, if possible, disable it until corrective actions can be taken.</p> <br>
